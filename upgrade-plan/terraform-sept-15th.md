# Terraform - Sept 15th

Certainly! Here’s a more detailed plan with descriptions and instructions for each task:

#### **Basic Tasks**

1. **Terraform Basics**
   * **Task:** Write a simple Terraform configuration to provision an Azure Virtual Machine.
   * **Objective:** Understand basic Terraform syntax, providers, and resources.
   * **Instructions:**
     1. Create a new directory for your Terraform project.
     2. In the directory, create a file named `main.tf`.
     3. Define the Azure provider and create a basic VM resource.
     4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.
     5. Run `terraform apply` to provision the VM.
   * **Hint:** Start with the [Azure provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs) for configuration examples.
2. **State Management**
   * **Task:** Explore and manage Terraform state files.
   * **Objective:** Learn about Terraform state files, state locking, and remote backends.
   * **Instructions:**
     1. Create a simple configuration and run `terraform apply`.
     2. Explore the state file (`terraform.tfstate`) and understand its contents.
     3. Set up a remote backend (e.g., Azure Storage) to store the state file remotely.
   * **Hint:** Refer to the [State Management documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state) for details on state files and remote backends.
3. **Variables and Outputs**
   * **Task:** Modify your configuration to use variables and outputs.
   * **Objective:** Learn to use variables to make your configurations dynamic and outputs to access information about the provisioned resources.
   * **Instructions:**
     1. Create a `variables.tf` file to define variables (e.g., VM size, location).
     2. Update `main.tf` to use these variables.
     3. Create an `outputs.tf` file to define outputs (e.g., VM public IP).
     4. Run `terraform apply` and verify the output values.
   * **Hint:** Check out the [Variables documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-variables) for syntax and usage.

#### **Intermediate Tasks**

4. **Modules**
   * **Task:** Create a reusable module to define the VM configuration and use it in your main configuration.
   * **Objective:** Understand how to create and use Terraform modules for better organization and reuse.
   * **Instructions:**
     1. Create a `modules` directory and add a subdirectory (e.g., `vm`) for your VM module.
     2. Define your VM configuration in `modules/vm/main.tf`.
     3. In your main configuration, use the module block to call the VM module.
     4. Run `terraform apply` to provision the VM using the module.
   * **Hint:** Review the [Module documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules) for best practices and examples.
5. **Terraform with GitLab CI/CD**
   * **Task:** Set up a GitLab CI/CD pipeline to automatically apply Terraform configurations on code changes.
   * **Objective:** Integrate Terraform with GitLab CI/CD to automate infrastructure provisioning.
   * **Instructions:**
     1. In your project’s root directory, create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
     2. Define stages for `validate`, `plan`, and `apply`.
     3. Use GitLab’s CI/CD environment variables to securely manage Azure credentials.
     4. Commit the file and push changes to trigger the pipeline.
   * **Hint:** Follow the [GitLab CI/CD documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) for setting up pipelines and using environment variables.
6. **Terraform and Docker**
   * **Task:** Write a Terraform configuration to provision an Azure VM and deploy a Docker container on it.
   * **Objective:** Understand how to manage Docker containers using Terraform.
   * **Instructions:**
     1. Add Docker-related configuration to your VM setup in Terraform.
     2. Use the [Docker provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kreuzwerker/docker/latest/docs) to define Docker containers and images.
     3. Build a Docker image locally and push it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
     4. Configure Terraform to pull and run this image on the VM.
   * **Hint:** Refer to the [Docker provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kreuzwerker/docker/latest/docs) for configuring Docker resources.

#### **Advanced Tasks**

7. **Advanced Terraform Features**
   * **Task:** Implement advanced Terraform features such as Terraform Cloud, workspaces, and dynamic blocks.
   * **Objective:** Gain deeper insights into more complex Terraform use cases and features.
   * **Instructions:**
     1. Explore Terraform Cloud or Enterprise for remote operations and collaboration.
     2. Set up workspaces to manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).
     3. Use dynamic blocks to handle resource configurations that vary.
   * **Hint:** The [Advanced Terraform Topics](https://www.terraform.io/docs) page provides insights into these features.
8. **Terraform with Azure and Docker CI/CD**
   * **Task:** Create a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitLab for a project that includes Terraform provisioning, Docker image building, and deployment.
   * **Objective:** Integrate Terraform, Docker, and GitLab CI/CD into a cohesive workflow.
   * **Instructions:**
     1. Extend your `.gitlab-ci.yml` to include stages for building Docker images and deploying them.
     2. Configure Terraform to provision infrastructure and GitLab to build and deploy Docker images to the infrastructure.
     3. Test the end-to-end pipeline to ensure everything works together.
   * **Hint:** Combine elements from the [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs) documentation to create a comprehensive pipeline.
9. **Multi-Environment Management**
   * **Task:** Set up Terraform configurations to manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) with GitLab CI/CD.
   * **Objective:** Learn to manage infrastructure across different environments with Terraform and GitLab.
   * **Instructions:**
     1. Use Terraform workspaces or separate directories for different environments.
     2. Configure GitLab CI/CD pipelines to deploy to specific environments based on branches or tags.
     3. Implement environment-specific configurations and manage secrets securely.
   * **Hint:** Review the [Managing Multiple Environments](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/environments) section of Terraform documentation for best practices.
