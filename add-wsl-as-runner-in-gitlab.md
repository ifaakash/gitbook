# Add WSL as runner in Gitlab

If you want to register a machine ( consider my wsl machine ) as runner in two gitlab projects, then i need to run the "register" command twice.

**Register as a Specific Runner for Another Project**: You can also register the same WSL machine as a **specific runner** for other projects by using a different token for each project. When registering a new runner, follow these steps:

* Run the registration command on your WSL machine (`gitlab-runner register`).
* Provide the new projectâ€™s URL and the registration token from the other GitLab project.
* Configure the runner with a new name to differentiate it from others.



Some important path related to runner in linux machine:

{% hint style="info" %}
"/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml"

/usr/local/bin/gitlab-runner
{% endhint %}

```
