#### **Beginner Level: Understanding Docker Basics**

1. **What is Docker?**
   * **Exercise**: Research and write a comparison between Docker and Virtual Machines. Create a diagram showing how Docker works compared to a VM.
2. **Installing Docker**
   * **Exercise**: Install Docker on your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Verify the installation by running `docker version` and `docker info`.
3. **Docker Architecture**
   * **Exercise**: Run the following commands and understand the output: `docker info`, `docker ps`, and `docker version`. Explore each component (Engine, Daemon, Client) and how they interact.
4. **Basic Docker Commands**
   * **Exercise**:
     * Pull an image: `docker pull nginx`
     * Run a container: `docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx`
     * Check running containers: `docker ps`
     * Stop and remove the container: `docker stop <container_id>`, `docker rm <container_id>`
     * Check the status of the container before and after stopping it.
5. **Docker Images and Containers**
   * **Exercise**:
     * Explore official images on Docker Hub (e.g., Nginx, Redis, Ubuntu).
     * Pull and run any official image.
     * Use `docker exec` to enter a running container and explore the file system.
6. **Docker Hub**
   * **Exercise**:
     * Create a Docker Hub account.
     * Pull an official image (e.g., Ubuntu).
     * Modify the container (install some software), commit the changes, and push your image to Docker Hub.

#### **Intermediate Level: Building, Networking, and Data Management**

7. **Building Docker Images**
   * **Exercise**:
     * Write a basic `Dockerfile` for a Python Flask application.
     * Use `docker build` to create an image and run the container.
     * Experiment with adding layers (installing packages, copying files) and rebuilding the image. Check build caching behavior.
8. **Docker Volumes**
   * **Exercise**:
     * Create and run a container with a bind mount: `docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container`.
     * Create and inspect a named volume: `docker volume create`, `docker volume ls`.
     * Use volumes to persist data in a MySQL container.
9. **Docker Networking**
   * **Exercise**:
     * Create two containers and connect them using a bridge network.
     * Use `docker network inspect` to view network details.
     * Run containers on a custom network and test communication using `ping` between containers.
10. **Environment Variables in Docker**
    * **Exercise**:
      * Create a container with environment variables: `docker run -e "ENV_VAR=value" nginx`.
      * Write a `Dockerfile` that accepts environment variables using `ARG` and `ENV`.
      * Access and print environment variables inside the running container.
11. **Docker Compose**
    * **Exercise**:
      * Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to set up a multi-container application (e.g., Nginx + MySQL).
      * Run `docker-compose up`, explore the services, and stop the application using `docker-compose down`.
